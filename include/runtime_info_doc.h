 * The Runtime Information API provides functions to obtain runtime information, containing miscellaneous system preference.
 * The Runtime Information available is stored in key/value pairs, where there may be different data types for the value.
 *
 * The runtime_info_set_changed_cb() registers a callback function for a particular key, which will be invoked by the System Service if the state matching that key changes.
